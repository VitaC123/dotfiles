#+TITLE: Dotfiles

My configuration files for Bash, Vim, Emacs, OSX, etc.

* Contents

  - =install=: Installer; run ~./install~ from the root =dotfiles/= directory
  - =lib/=: Dotfiles to be symlinked into home directory
  - =bin/=: Executables; directory symlinked into home directory and added to =$PATH=
  - =sources/=: Files sourced upon startup (e.g. aliases, functions, exports)
  - =completion/=: ZSH command completion files; see also =sources/completions=
  - =misc/=: Better defaults for Mac OS, oh-my-zsh theme, etc.

* Installation

 An install script is provided to handle installation. It will symlink most
 files into your home directory.

 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ git clone git@github.com:nwolfe/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   $ cd ~/.dotfiles
   $ ./install
 #+END_SRC

** Mac OS

 Configuration is in the [[./misc/osx][misc/osx]] file. You must source it manually.
